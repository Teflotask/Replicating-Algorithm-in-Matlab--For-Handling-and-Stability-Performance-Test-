# Replicating-Algorithm-in-Matlab--For-Handling-and-Stability-Performance-Test-
This project involved replicating Handling and Stability Performance Test algorithm using matlab 

In this project I needed to create an app that users can use to test the stability of a vehicle based on . The app should run different tests and show the results in a scatter plot and a filter plot, 


Test functions include 
Snake Test 
Step Input Test
 Pulse Input Test 
Steering Return Performance Test
 Steering Lightness Test 
Steady-State Rotation Test
Steering Wheel Center Area Test

each tst has its own formula or model 

how can i do this do i need to use app designer alone or also simulink?
